# anemia
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes anemia prevalence among pregnant women in India using data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5). The objective is to identify key health, socio-economic, and regional factors associated with anemia and generate insights that can inform public health policy and maternal health interventions.

The analysis was conducted during my internship at the Institute of Economic Growth (IEG), New Delhi (June–July 2025).

🎯 Objectives

Examine anemia prevalence among pregnant women across India

Analyze relationships between hemoglobin levels and factors such as:

BMI

Age

Education level

Income / wealth index

Geographic location

Identify high-risk populations and regional disparities

📊 Dataset

Source: NFHS-5 (National Family Health Survey, India)

Population: Pregnant women

Key Variables:

Hemoglobin levels

BMI

Age

Education

Wealth index

State and regional indicators

🧪 Methodology

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handling missing values

Variable selection and categorization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution analysis of hemoglobin levels

Regional and demographic comparisons

Statistical Analysis

Chi-Square tests to examine associations between categorical variables

ANOVA to compare mean hemoglobin levels across groups

Visualization

Trends in hemoglobin levels

Identification of high-risk groups using charts and plots

🔍 Key Insights

Significant regional and socio-economic disparities in anemia prevalence

Higher risk observed among specific demographic and income groups

Education and BMI show strong associations with hemoglobin levels

(Detailed findings are documented in the report and visualizations.)
